# Alex-Agnes-Website

A website to showcase the work of lighting and set designer, Alex Agnes.

### Ideas
Probably don't need two .py files now.
Use S3 bucket to store JSON files of show data and images from the shows. 
 - Gets around having to maintain a database.
 - New stuff uploaded via webform 
 - Keep each show in a folder structure that we can iterate over?

 ### Issues
  - Protecting upload page
  - How to access the S3 stuff lol
